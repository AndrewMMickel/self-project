                    <p>One of the Ten Shining Weapons that was found when Zero got reactivated. It's a triangle shaped blade that glows green and is embedded with the same technology as Zero's X-Buster, which allows both to be charged for powerful attacks. There is actually two of these sabers that Zero uses, and he makes good use of them to create deadly combos.</p>

                    <p>The first of three weapons constructed for Zero by Cereveau. The Z saber is mounted onto Zero's forearm and spun at high speeds to create an energy shield! How cool! It can block most attacks, but is surprisingly weak to melee attacks.. But it can be thrown from a distance to cut up enemies then return to Zero</p>

                    <p>A standard issue handheld gun originally used by Resistance member Milan. What's intewresting is that it doesn't use bullets. Zero loads his saber into it instead! This allows the gun to shoot energy blasts and even charge them, in the same way the saber can.</p>
