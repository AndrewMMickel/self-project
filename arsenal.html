                    <h4>Z Saber</h4>
                    <img  id="img" src="https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/10460/811865-zero_saber.jpg" alt="saber">
                    <p>One of the Ten Shining Weapons that was found when Zero got reactivated. It's a triangle shaped blade that glows green and is embedded with the same technology as Zero's X-Buster, which allows both to be charged for powerful attacks. There is actually two of these sabers that Zero uses, and he makes good use of them to create deadly combos.</p>

                    <h4>Zero Boomerang</h4>
                    <img  id="img" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/megaman/images/5/5c/MMZ_Zero_%28Shield_Boomerang%29.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/150?cb=20070328144949" alt="Zero boomerang">
                    <p>The first of three weapons constructed for Zero by Cereveau. The Z saber is mounted onto Zero's forearm and spun at high speeds to create an energy shield! How cool! It can block most attacks, but is surprisingly weak to melee attacks.. But it can be thrown from a distance to cut up enemies then return to Zero</p>
                </div>
                <div class="weapon-slots">
                    <h4>Chain Rod</h4>
                    <img  id="img" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/megaman/images/3/3b/MMZ2_Zero_%28Chain_Rod%29.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/140?cb=20151029020954" alt="Chain Rod">
                    <p>Created from the remains of the Triple Rod. It is an energy chain with a sharp point that can be used to hook onto various surfaces and enemies. It can hold some enemies in place by stunning them, pull them closer to Zero for further attacks, or to simply impale them from mid-distance. Very useful and one of Cerveau's best creations.</p>
                    <div class="weapon-slots">
                        <h4>Zero Knuckle</h4>
                        <img  id="img" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/megaman/images/7/7c/MMZ4_Zero_%28Zero_Knuckle%29.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20151029021435" alt="Zero Knuckle">
                        <p>When this weapon was obtained all of Cerveaue's weapons were destroyed in the fight with Omega. The Knuckle consists of a Z-shaped chip implanted into Zero's palms. It allows him to rip off certain types of weapons (such as blasters, rocket launchers or axes) from enemy Mechaniloids or weak Reploids.</p>

                    <h4>Buster Shot</h4>

                    <p>A standard issue handheld gun originally used by Resistance member Milan. What's intewresting is that it doesn't use bullets. Zero loads his saber into it instead! This allows the gun to shoot energy blasts and even charge them, in the same way the saber can.</p>

                    <h4>Triple Rod</h4>

                    <p>Another weapon created by Cerveau. It is a modified Z-saber hilt that can extend up to three times and can attack in all directions with an energy tipped edge. This weapon sadly doesn't survive past Zero's first mission, but the remains are used to create the Chain Rod.</p>

                    <h4>Triple Rod</h4>

                    <p>Yet another weapon created by Cerveau. It is a pair of energy tofas used for rapid attacks. They can be charged to create a shockwave that knocks back enemies and objects. It can even be used by Zero to gain extra Vertical height!</p>
